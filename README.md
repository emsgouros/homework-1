# <Search Engine Optimization>

## Description

I wanted to make this company's website more accessible and optimized for search engines.
It allows people who use screen readers to have descriptions of images. It also allows the website to have more traffic based on what people plug into search engines.
I learned how using class and id can really help organize your css!

## Usage

Added alt attributes to images.
Added a title.
Added semantic HTML elements
Organized HTML and CSS by using id and class
Added an element for the span to work in the heading!

```md
    ![HTML-1] (./assets/README-images/HTML-1.png)
    ```
    ```md
    ![HTML-2] (./assets/README-images/HTML-2.png)
    ```
    ```md
    ![HTML-3] (./assets/README-images/HTML-3.png)
    ```
    ```md
    ![CSS-1] (./assets/README-images/CSS-1.png)
    ```
     ```md
    ![CSS-2] (./assets/README-images/CSS-2.png)
    ```
     ```md
    ![CSS-3] (./assets/README-images/CSS-3.png)
    ```
     ```md
    ![CSS-4] (./assets/README-images/CSS-4.png)
    ```
     ```md
    ![CSS-5] (./assets/README-images/CSS-5.png)
